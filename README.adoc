= Spring Data MongoDB

The primary goal of the https://projects.spring.io/spring-data[Spring Data] project is to make it easier to build Spring-powered applications that use new data access technologies such as non-relational databases, map-reduce frameworks, and cloud based data services.

The Spring Data MongoDB project aims to provide a familiar and consistent Spring-based programming model for new datastores while retaining store-specific features and capabilities. The Spring Data MongoDB project provides integration with the MongoDB document database. Key functional areas of Spring Data MongoDB are a POJO centric model for interacting with a MongoDB DBCollection and easily writing a repository style data access layer.

== Quick Start

=== Maven configuration

Add the Maven dependency:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.data</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-data-mongodb</artifactId>
  <version>${version}.RELEASE</version>
</dependency>
----

If you'd rather like the latest snapshots of the upcoming major version, use our Maven snapshot repository and declare the appropriate dependency version.

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.data</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-data-mongodb</artifactId>
  <version>${version}.BUILD-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>

<repository>
  <id>spring-libs-snapshot</id>
  <name>Spring Snapshot Repository</name>
  <url>https://repo.spring.io/libs-snapshot</url>
</repository>
----

=== MongoTemplate

MongoTemplate is the central support class for Mongo database operations. It provides:

* Basic POJO mapping support to and from BSON
* Convenience methods to interact with the store (insert object, update objects) and MongoDB specific ones (geo-spatial operations, upserts, map-reduce etc.)
* Connection affinity callback
* Exception translation into Spring's https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/dao.html#dao-exceptions[technology agnostic DAO exception hierarchy].

=== Spring Data repositories

To simplify the creation of data repositories Spring Data MongoDB provides a generic repository programming model. It will automatically create a repository proxy for you that adds implementations of finder methods you specify on an interface. 

For example, given a `Person` class with first and last name properties, a `PersonRepository` interface that can query for `Person` by last name and when the first name matches a like expression is shown below:

[source,java]
----
public interface PersonRepository extends CrudRepository<Person, Long> {

  List<Person> findByLastname(String lastname);

  List<Person> findByFirstnameLike(String firstname);
}
----

The queries issued on execution will be derived from the method name. Extending `CrudRepository` causes CRUD methods being pulled into the interface so that you can easily save and find single entities and collections of them.

You can have Spring automatically create a proxy for the interface by using the following JavaConfig:

[source,java]
----
@Configuration
@EnableMongoRepositories
class ApplicationConfig extends AbstractMongoConfiguration {

  @Override
  public MongoClient mongoClient() throws Exception {
    return new MongoClient();
  }

  @Override
  protected String getDatabaseName() {
    return "springdata";
  }
}
----

This sets up a connection to a local MongoDB instance and enables the detection of Spring Data repositories (through `@EnableMongoRepositories`). The same configuration would look like this in XML:

[source,xml]
----
<bean id="template" class="org.springframework.data.mongodb.core.MongoTemplate">
  <constructor-arg>
    <bean class="com.mongodb.MongoClient">
       <constructor-arg value="localhost" />
       <constructor-arg value="27017" />
    </bean>
  </constructor-arg>
  <constructor-arg value="database" />
</bean>

<mongo:repositories base-package="com.acme.repository" />
----

This will find the repository interface and register a proxy object in the container. You can use it as shown below:

[source,java]
----
@Service
public class MyService {

  private final PersonRepository repository;

  @Autowired
  public MyService(PersonRepository repository) {
    this.repository = repository;
  }

  public void doWork() {

     repository.deleteAll();

     Person person = new Person();
     person.setFirstname("Oliver");
     person.setLastname("Gierke");
     person = repository.save(person);

     List<Person> lastNameResults = repository.findByLastname("Gierke");
     List<Person> firstNameResults = repository.findByFirstnameLike("Oli*");
 }
}
----

=== MongoDB 4.0 Transactions

As of version 4 MongoDB supports https://www.mongodb.com/transactions[Transactions]. Transactions are built on top of
 `ClientSessions` and therefore require an active session.

`MongoTransactionManager` is the gateway to the well known Spring transaction support. It allows applications to use
https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/transaction.html[managed transaction features of Spring].
The `MongoTransactionManager` binds a `ClientSession` to the thread. `MongoTemplate` automatically detects those and operates on them accordingly.

[source,java]
----
@Configuration
static class Config extends AbstractMongoConfiguration {

	@Bean
	MongoTransactionManager transactionManager(MongoDbFactory dbFactory) {
		return new MongoTransactionManager(dbFactory);
	}

	// ...
}

@Component
public class StateService {

	@Transactional
	void someBusinessFunction(Step step) {

		template.insert(step);

		process(step);

		template.update(Step.class).apply(Update.set("state", // ...
	};
});

== Contributing to Spring Data

Here are some ways for you to get involved in the community:

* Get involved with the Spring community on Stackoverflow and help out on the https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/spring-data-mongodb[spring-data-mongodb] tag by responding to questions and joining the debate.
* Create https://jira.spring.io/browse/DATAMONGO[JIRA] tickets for bugs and new features and comment and vote on the ones that you are interested in.
* Github is for social coding: if you want to write code, we encourage contributions through pull requests from https://help.github.com/forking/[forks of this repository]. If you want to contribute code this way, please reference a JIRA ticket as well covering the specific issue you are addressing.
* Watch for upcoming articles on Spring by https://spring.io/blog[subscribing] to spring.io.

Before we accept a non-trivial patch or pull request we will need you to https://cla.pivotal.io/sign/spring[sign the Contributor License Agreement]. Signing the contributorâ€™s agreement does not grant anyone commit rights to the main repository, but it does mean that we can accept your contributions, and you will get an author credit if we do. If you forget to do so, you'll be reminded when you submit a pull request. Active contributors might be asked to join the core team, and given the ability to merge pull requests.

== Running CI tasks locally

Since this pipeline is purely Docker-based, it's easy to:

* Debug what went wrong on your local machine.
* Test out a a tweak to your test routine before sending it out.
* Experiment against a new image before submitting your pull request.

All of these use cases are great reasons to essentially run what the CI server does on your local machine.

IMPORTANT: To do this you must have Docker installed on your machine.

1. `docker run -it --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)",target=/spring-data-mongodb-github springci/spring-data-openjdk8-with-mongodb-4.0:latest /bin/bash`
+
This will launch the Docker image and mount your source code at `spring-data-mongodb-github`.
+
2. `cd spring-data-mongodb-github`
+
Next, run the tests from inside the container:
+
3. `./mvnw clean dependency:list test -Dsort -Dbundlor.enabled=false -B` (or with whatever profile you need to test out)

Since the container is binding to your source, you can make edits from your IDE and continue to run build jobs.

If you need to package things up, do this:

1. `docker run -it --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)",target=/spring-data-mongodb-github springci/spring-data-openjdk8-with-mongodb-4.0:latest /bin/bash`
+
This will launch the Docker image and mount your source code at `spring-data-mongodb-github`.
+
2. `cd spring-data-mongodb-github`
+
Next, package things from inside the container doing this:
+
3. `./mvnw clean dependency:list package -Dsort -Dbundlor.enabled=false -B`

NOTE: Docker containers can eat up disk space fast! From time to time, run `docker system prune` to clean out old images.
